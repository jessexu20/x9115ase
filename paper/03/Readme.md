##### ii. Most Important Keywords 

<b> ii1. Product Line Engineering</b>  
Product Line Engineering is a development paradigm that explicitly addresses reuse by differentiating between two kinds of development processes: In domain engineering, the domain artifacts of the product line are defined and developed. In application engineering, customer- and/or market-specific products are derived from the domain artifacts by binding the variability defined in the domain artifacts according to customer and/or marketspecific needs. 
The overall quality of the product line and its derived products mainly depends on the quality of the domain artifacts. 

<b> ii2. Model checking </b>  
Model checking is a technique for quality assurance that facilitates the verification of properties (typically specified in CTL) of a system (typically specified in a statetransition model).
In software engineering for single systems, model checking is an established technique for verifying development artifacts in requirements engineering, design, realization, and test in different domains such as in the automotive or avionic industry. 

<b> ii3. Variability</b>  
The extent to which data points in a statistical distribution or data set diverge from the average or mean value.

<b> ii4. Domain Artifact</b>  
Domain specific knowledge.

##### iii. Brief notes on items 
<b> iii1. Motivational Statements</b>  
Authors aim in extending existing model checking approaches to facilitate the verification of domain artifacts in product line engineering.

<b> iii2. Hypotheses</b>  
Authors claim this paper contributes:
a) the model checking problems faced in product line engineering mainly caused by the variability of the domain artifacts is investigated,
b) a model checking approach for verifying domain artifacts in product line engineering which takes the variability defined for the product line into account is presented,
c) the applicability of their approach is demonstrated by applying our tool prototype to an extended example.

<b> iii3. Data</b>  
a) A small sample specification. It consists of five variable I/O-automata and an orthogonal variability model which specifies six variation points and 14 variants. Overall 189 products can be derived from this specification. The product automaton of the specification consists of 12.000 states and 29.000 transitions. 
b) a realistic specification. It consists of six variable I/O-automata and the orthogonal variability model of the specification consists of ten variation points and 46 variants and allows the derivation of 237 different products. The product automaton of the specification consists of more than 68.000 states and 174.000 transitions. 

<b> iii4. Related works</b>  
a) Symbolic Model Checking;
b) Parameterized Model Checking;
c) Model Checking of Partial State Spaces;
d) Model Checking and Verification of Domain Artifacts.

##### iv. Three ways the paper could be improved.  
<b> iv1. Baseline result</b>  
Currently, no baseline result is provided. We would like to see the baseline result in this area and the improvements by introducing the new methods.

<b> iv2. More experiments</b>  
Lots of algorithms, concepts, and analyses are described in this paper while few experiments are conducted.

<b> iv3. Future work</b>  
Future works are desired since they can provide users a clear image about open issues of future issues that might become the motivation for the next round of research.
