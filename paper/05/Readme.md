### ii. Most Important Keywords

#### ii1. Feature-oriented software development (FOSD)
Feature-oriented software development (FOSD) is a paradigm for the construction, customization, and synthesis of large-scale software systems, which aims to decompose a software system in terms of the features it provides.

#### ii2. feature
A feature is a unit of functionality of a software system that satisfies a requirement, represents a design decision, and provides a potential configuration option, a conglomeration of different ideas, methods, tools, languages, formalisms, and theories.

#### ii3. domain analysis
Domain Analysis is the process of analyzing related software systems in a domain to find their common and variable parts, which determines which features are part of the software system or software product line.

#### ii4. feature model
Feature model is a compact representation of all the products of the Software Product Line in terms of "features", which are visually represented by means of feature diagrams. Feature models are widely used during the whole product line development process and are commonly used as input to produce other assets such as documents, architecture definition, or pieces of code.


#### ii5. feature interaction
Feature interaction occurs when the integration of two features would modify the behavior of one or both features. It is a situation in which two or more features exhibit unexpected behavior that does not occur when the features are used in isolation.
